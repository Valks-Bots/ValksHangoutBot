### Stuff that Needs Doing
- Better ModMail System (User sends message through ModMail, ModMail replies saying opening up a new report, ModMail creates a new channel under a specified category for the report, sends a new message in that channel with the users content, always reacting to each new message with an emote prompting you to close the session)
- Status that says "DM to Contact Staff"
- Partner Message Tracking (Track all the partnerships that PMs do on a daily / weekly / monthly basis)
- Only 1 person can send 1 message in #introductions
- Count to X Anime Girls (automatically rename the channel to be a higher number if the users count over the limit)
- Smash or Pass (If user says smash or pass and sends image at same time, react with smash or pass emotes)
